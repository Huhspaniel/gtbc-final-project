        Gets all tracks, filtering based on time period, and

        all time. If {u} is not defined, gets tracks for all users.
        
        For example, if {period} = 'week,3', will only get tracks 
        from past 3 weeks. If {u} = 'user1_id,user2_id,user3_id'
        will only get tracks posted by user1, user2, user3.


    /api/tracks/following?period={unit},{quantity}
        Only gets tracks posted by those a user is following.
        Only accessible when user is logged in using JWT authentication.
        The JWT token will automatically be stored in cookies upon login.
